            <p>I am your instructor for this course. My last name is pronounced
                like orchards with a B in front of it. </p>
            <p>I am a graduate of Brigham Young University-Idaho with a
                Bachelors in Web Design and Development. After graduation I
                decided to become an instructor for the school and give back to
                the school. I found that I enjoyed teaching while I was a
                student.</p>
            <p>I live in the desert of Southern California about 20 miles outside of Palm Springs, CA. I am an IT Consultant and professional Web Developer and do a lot of consulting for local companies. I am always working on a new web project using PHP, JavaScript, CSS/SCSS, MySQL technologies. You will learn about these as you learn more about web development.</p>
            <p>My wife and daughter also received their Bachelors from
                BYU-Idaho. My wife earned her Bachelors of Science in Nursing
                and my daughter earned her Business Administration Bachelors. We
                all graduated the same semester, April 2020 right after the lock-downs started. </p>
            <p>I am the Elders Quorum President in my ward and my wife if the Relief Society President. As such we are very busy with our callings and coordinating the Lords work in the Ward. We have
                eight grandchildren and we will get at least one more in 2024.</p>
