          <details>
            <summary>What rivers do you run?</summary>
            <p> We run a variety of rivers depending on the permits we get from
              Firsh and Game each year. We do run some local one day trips for
              those that want a taste of what it is like to run some small
              rapids. </p>
            <p> We apply for the following rivers at minimum each year:
              <strong>Colorado:</strong> Yampa &amp; Animus <br>
              <strong>Idaho:</strong> Selway &amp; Lochsa <br>
              <strong>Oregon:</strong> Owyhee &amp; Illinois <br>
              <strong>California:</strong> North Fork American &amp; Kaweah <br>
              <strong>Arizon:</strong> Salt River <br>
              <strong>New Mexico:</strong> Rio Grande <br>
              <strong>Utah:</strong> San Juan &amp; various parts of the
              Colorado including Cataract Canyon
            </p>

            <summary>What time of the year are these runs?</summary>
            <p> These runs can start as early at mid March and go until late
              July sometime early August. It all depends on how much rainfall
              and water there is on the rivers to be able to have a fun and safe
              trip. </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>Do I need to be able to swim?</summary>
            <p> Yes, you must be able to swim and feel comfortable in the water.
              Even though each person has a life vest, each paddler on a rafting
              boat has to know how to swim. </p>

          <details>
            <summary>Is there a minimum age to participate?</summary>
            <p> Yes. Depending on the river and how fast the river is flowing
              will depend on the minimum age. Early in the season it is
              generally 13 yrs old. Latter in the season it wil 10 yrs old. </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary>What should I wear</summary>
            <p> For lower body: Swimming wear (or a change of underclothing) to
              wear under your rafting pants and tennis shoes. These will get
              wet. </p>
            <p> For the upper body: Bring a long sleeved shirt to wear under
              your rafting jacket (it will get wet), any necessary medications
              (asthma inhalers, etc.) and a towel to dry off after your trip
              each day. </p>
            <p> For multiple day trips make sure you bring warm cloths such as
              sweatshirt and pants for the evenings. It can and does get quite
              cold along the river. Bring a sleeping bag for overnight trips.
            </p>
            <p> We supply all other equipment that you will need including the
              food. </p>
