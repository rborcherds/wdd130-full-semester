            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to show others what the youth of
                our stake did to learn about the pioneers that crossed the
                plains during the years 1847 to 1851. This was a re-enactment of
                them pulling handcarts and along the way learn about some of the
                stories and things that they went through.</p>

            <h4>James Kirkwood - Willie Handcart Company</h4>
            <p>Let me tell you of James Kirkwood. James was from Glasgow,
                Scotland. On the trip west, James was accompanied by his widowed
                mother and three brothers, one of whom, Thomas, was 19 and
                crippled and had to ride in the handcart. James's primary
                responsibility on the trek was to care for his little
                four-year-old brother, Joseph, while his mother and oldest
                brother, Robert, pulled the cart. As they climbed Rocky Ridge,
                it was snowing and there was a bitter cold wind blowing. It took
                the whole company 27 hours to travel 15 miles. When little
                Joseph became too weary to walk, James, the older brother, had
                no choice but to carry him. Left behind the main group, James
                and Joseph made their way slowly to camp. When the two finally
                arrived at the fireside, James, “having so faithfully carried
                out his task, collapsed and died from exposure and
                over-exertion.”</p>
            <p>Latter in life Joseph said this "What you do for your older
                brother that gave his life so you could live? </p>
            <h4>1855 (age 23), McFarland, Archibald</h4>
            <p> I was born on the 17th of December 1832 in the village of
                Sinclair Town in the parish of Dyart Fifeshire, Scotland. My
                father's name was William McFarland and my mother's name was
                Margaret McCormick. My father was twice married, my mother being
                his second wife; his first wife's name being Catherine Boyd. She
                bore my father two children. One died when he was quite young,
                and my other brother, whose name was Charles, enlisted in the
                British Army when he was eighteen and I was a boy of eight
                years. There were ten years difference in our ages. He went to
                India and died there in the year 1852. He was born on April 23,
                1823.</p>
            <p> My father's first wife was a widow when he married her. She had
                one daughter whose name was Elizabeth McDonald. She was born in
                1818 and died when I was about fifteen years of age. She left
                three children, two girls and a boy.</p>
            <h5>To America</h5>
            <p> After I got married, I commenced the most eventful period of my
                life, for I, with all my father's family started to the
                gathering place of the people of God in Utah. We left Liverpool,
                or I should have said we were going to leave Liverpool on the
                ship Helious, but after we embarked and had been on board two
                nights during a storm she broke loose from her anchor in the
                river and ran aground, and the government officers would not let
                her go to sea until she had been inspected on the dry docks, so
                we were put ashore again, and had to stay one month. She was
                advertised to sail on December 20, 1854, but we didn't get to
                sail until sometime in January 1855. We then sailed on a ship
                called the Charles Buck, and as there was some dispute between
                our shipping agent, Franklin D. Richards and the captain of the
                Helious, we did not get the provisions that were provided for
                us, and the consequence was that before we got half over the sea
                our provisions began to run short, and we had rather a hard
                time. Needless to say, we were greatly blessed of the Lord in
                our journey and arrived all safe in New Orleans on March 5,
                1855, and from here we took a steamer to St. Louis up the
                Mississippi River. We were eleven days on the river between New
                Orleans and St. Louis. We stayed here some eight days and met
                some of our old friends who were very kind. I will just mention
                some of their names. Foremost among them was Alexander Dow, who
                has since come to Utah, apostatized and gone back. James and
                Thomas Adamson from the Boreland who were very kind. James never
                came to Utah, but Thomas gathered that same year and is now a
                faithful man of God. From St. Louis we took a steamboat for
                Atcheson, Kansas. We were nine days on this journey. There were
                then but few inhabitants in this part of the west only three
                houses in the town. We moved out some six miles from the river
                and took up a section of land. That is to say, the brethren who
                were in charge of the emigration for that year, and we emigrants
                commenced to build houses, fence and plow the land.</p>
            <h5>The Trek</h5>
            <p> We stayed here until July 2nd when we organized into a company
                with Richard Ballantyne as captain. While we were camped here
                cholera broke out in the camp, but through the blessings of the
                Lord not many died. There were eleven persons to each wagon to
                travel across the plains, and there being nine of our own family
                there were only two other persons traveling in our wagon. The
                cattle and wagons belonged to the P Emigrating Company and the
                emigrants paid so much for their use. Our wagon contained my
                father and mother, myself and wife, I being the only married one
                at the time, my brothers James, William and Robert and sisters
                Mary Ann and Janet, a young woman named Jane Pilkinstin and a
                motherless girl named Eliza Pinder. Our traveling from the
                Missouri River with the exception of the wagon tracks that
                former companies had made, was a trackless desert. We saw the
                first herd of buffalo the second day after we started, and if I
                remember right, killed one the third day. We would average about
                fifteen miles per day, and we saw herds of buffalo and deer
                almost every day, and when we got on the Platte River the whole
                country seemed alive with them. We killed what we wanted for use
                but never wantonly destroyed any. Our journey across the plains
                and through the mountains was very laborious and wearying, and I
                have many times thought there was no comparison between us and
                ancient Israel, for with them the Lord preserved their shoes and
                clothes, but with us when we arrived in the valley of Salt Lake
                most of our clothes were worn out and our shoes worn off our
                feet.</p>
            <h5>Salt Lake Valley</h5>
            <p> We arrived in the Valley on September 25, 1855, almost worn out
                but we were full of hope and full of the spirit of our Holy
                religion. In coming across the plains we had two of the sisters
                shot, and both died. The one was shot through the carelessness
                of a young man in handling a gun around camp while a band of
                Indians were around. Her name was Palmer. The other was shot
                when her husband, who had been hunting, brought in his gun and
                threw it down on the bed in the wagon, and when she went to make
                the bed she pulled the gun out by the barrel, and it went off.
                The shot lodged in her shoulder. We did not expect to see anyone
                we had been acquainted with, but Brother John Bowen was looking
                out for us, and took us to his house and treated us with great
                kindness. We stayed several days with him. I went to work for a
                man named Alexander Wright, but as I thought he wanted to impose
                upon me I left him and went to work for John Sharp in quarrying
                and making a canal for the Church. I worked for him one year for
                the sum of $150.00 and our board, but as I was married he paid
                me double or $300.00 and board for myself and wife. During the
                winter and spring we suffered considerably for want of food as
                there was not much in the country. The grasshoppers ate up
                almost everything the summer previous. My wife especially
                suffered as she was then carrying her first child and could not
                eat everything that came along, as I could. There were weeks she
                hardly ever tasted bread. I must say that through it all we were
                greatly blessed by the Lord for I never felt like complaining,
                and the spirit of the Lord bore me up and I felt to rejoice that
                I Was gathered among the people of God and had the privilege to
                help to build up Zion in the last days.</p>
            <p> There was a man, a neighbor from almost the same place in
                Scotland that we were from, I will not tell his name, who got to
                grumbling and complaining. He had more to eat than we had and
                did very little work. He never quit grumbling, but apostatized
                and took his whole family out of the Church. My brothers and I,
                out of our small wages, saved enough to buy us a new wagon and
                yoke of steer calves. The population of Salt Lake City was then
                about four or five thousand. The house where I lived was in the
                Twentieth Ward of the city. There were only a few houses, and
                women and children would come up there from the lower wards of
                the city in the spring to dig segos and eat them. There was also
                a thistle that grew in the lower parts of the city that we used
                to dig the roots and boil to eat.</p>

            <h4>1855 (age 43), Fish (Bell), Ann</h4>
            <h5>She came alone with children.</h5>
            <p>Ann Fish was born January 21, 1812 to Bert Fish and Dorothy
                Kirkup. At the age of 22 she married John Watson Bell, Sr., at
                Elsden, England, October 1834. Their first child, Ann Elizabeth,
                was born March 22, 1836. They moved to Newcastle on the Tyne
                River in 1836 and here two children were born to them, Robert
                and Alice Jane. They were baptized into the Church of Jesus
                Christ of Latter-day Saints August 8, 1840 by Elder Amos
                Fielding at Newcastle and in the spring of 1841, sailed for
                America on the ship Rochester in the Heber C. Kimball company
                with one hundred and twenty-eight other converts and seven of
                the Council of Twelve, Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Orson
                Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A. Smith and
                Willard Richards. They docked in New York harbor May 18, 1841.
            </p>
            <p> On May 1, 1846 they moved to Farmington, Van Buren county, Iowa
                and there on October 6th Joseph Alma was born. In the spring of
                1848 they moved to Indian Town, Pottawattamie county, Iowa,
                living in bark houses built and deserted by the Indians. Here
                they wintered with six other families. During this time five
                more children were born, one of them to the Bell family on
                Christmas day, 1848, who was given the name of Mary Frances.
                They ran out of provisions and had it not been for a large mound
                filled with corn stored by the Indians, they would have suffered
                greatly. In the spring the families moved to Kanesville, Iowa
                and lived there the next four years on rented farms. The Bell's
                last child was born here August 4, 1852. She was named Sarah
                Emily. In July of the following year she died.</p>
            <h5>The Trek</h5>
            <p>John Bell had very poor health, having suffered a sunstroke, and
                was advised to leave his family at Kanesville and go on to the
                Salt Lake Valley, which he did. Ann and the seven children
                followed the next year. She made arrangements to travel with a
                company of Saints, and with a yoke of cows, two yoke of oxen and
                two wagons filled with provisions and clothing, started on the
                journey. After a couple of days travel her cattle disappeared
                during the night. The captain said they could not be delayed
                while they searched for them and went on without her, telling
                her to wait for the next company. In a week or so the cattle
                were found and she and her children started out alone, thinking
                the next company would overtake her. Friends tried to dissuade
                her but she was determined, knowing her husband was somewhere
                out west and ill. She said she would go on if she landed in the
                Platte River. This statement almost became a fact for they were
                being ferried across the river when one of her wagons, not being
                properly blocked, rolled back into the water. The wagon was
                recovered but part of her precious belongings were lost.</p>
            <p>They traveled two weeks alone and then were overtaken by a
                government freight train, known as the "Truckee Train." The
                captain was a Frenchman and an Indian interpreter having lived
                among the Indians for fifteen years. He had twenty-five men in
                his company. They were surrounded several times by Indians, but
                Truckee knew how to handle them, giving them blankets and food.
                At one time the Indians became more troublesome than usual. Ann
                was frightened and knelt by her wagon praying for protection.
                The Indians saw her and rode way. After that the men called her
                their good luck charm. She traveled with the train until they
                reached Fort Laramie and there she joined the Gilbert and
                Gerrish Freight company bound for Salt Lake City, Utah. After
                traveling a few days they overtook the Mormon company that had
                left her behind and the captain asked her to finish the journey
                with them. She replied: "No, thanks, you didn't wait for me and
                now I am not waiting for you."</p>
            <p>Ann reached the valley several days ahead of the company,
                arriving in October 1855. She was thankful to God for His
                protection and grateful to the two freight lines who had been so
                kind to her and the children. Great was her disappointment
                however when she learned that her husband had gone to Carson
                valley to serve as a guard. It was harvest time and after a few
                days rest this little family started gleaning wheat in the
                fields. They gathered and threshed by hand eighteen bushels.
                After a time she was reunited with her husband.</p>
            <p>The Bell family lived in Salt Lake City for the next four years,
                then moved to Provo and, in 1867, President Young sent them to
                help colonize Mona, Utah.</p>

            <h4>President Brigham Young</h4>
            <cite>Excerpt from remarks given on October 5, 1856Journal of
                Discourses, Vol. 4, pp. 113-114</cite>
            <p>To-morrow our semi-annual Conference commences and I notice that
                many have come in from a distance. We shall have large
                congregations during the Conference, and we wish perfect order
                maintained.</p>
            <p>I will now give this people the subject and the text for the
                Elders who may speak today and during the Conference, it is
                this, on the 5th day of October, 1856, many of our brethren and
                sisters are on the Plains with hand-carts, and probably many are
                now seven hundred miles from this place, and they must be
                brought here, we must send assistance to them. The text will
                be—to get them here! I want the brethren who may speak to
                understand that their text is the people on the Plains, and the
                subject matter for this community is to send for them and bring
                them in before the winter sets in.</p>
            <p>That is my religion; that is the dictation of the Holy Ghost that
                I possess, it is to save the people. We must bring them in from
                the Plains, and when we get them here, we will try to keep the
                same spirit that we have had, and teach them the way of life and
                salvation; tell them how they can be saved, and how they can
                save their friends. This is the salvation I am now seeking for,
                to save our brethren that would be apt to perish, or suffer
                extremely, if we do not send them assistance. </p>
            <p>I shall call upon the Bishops this day, I shall not wait until
                to-morrow, nor until next day, for sixty good mule teams and
                twelve or fifteen wagons. I do not want to send oxen, I want
                good horses and mules. They are in this Territory, and we must
                have them; also twelve tons of flour and forty good teamsters,
                besides those that drive the teams. This is dividing my text
                into heads; first, forty good young menwho know how to drive
                teams, to take charge of the teams that are now managed by men,
                women, and children who know nothing about driving them; second,
                sixty or sixty-five good spans of mules, or horses, with
                harness, whipple-trees, neck- yokes, stretchers, load chains,
                &c.; and, thirdly, twenty-four thousand pounds of flour, which
                we have on hand.</p>
            <p>I will tell you all that your faith, religion, and profession of
                religion, will never save one soul of you in the celestial
                kingdom of our God, unless you carry out just such principles as
                I am now teaching you. Go and bring in those people now on the
                Plains, and attend strictly to those things which we call
                temporal, or temporal duties, otherwise your faith will be in
                vain; the preaching you have heard will be in vain to you, and
                you will sink to hell, unless you attend to the things we tell
                you. Any man or woman can reason this out in their own minds,
                without trouble. The Gospel has been already preached to those
                brethren and sisters now on the Plains; they have believed and
                obeyed it, and are willing to do anything for salvation; they
                are doing all they can do, and the Lord has done all that is
                required of Him to do, and has given us power to bring them in
                from the Plains, and teach them the further things of the
                kingdom of God, and prepare them to enter into the celestial
                kingdom of their Father. First and foremost is to secure our own
                salvation and do right pertaining to ourselves, and then extend
                the hand of right to save others.</p>
            <h4>Clark Allen Huntington</h4>
            <p>Born: December 6, 1831 in Watertown, New York<br> Age: 24<br>
                Rescuer</p>
            <p>Clark Allen Huntington was most commonly known as C.A. or Al. He
                was the oldest child of Dimick Baker and Fannie Maria Allen
                Huntington. Al’s grandparents were early converts to the Church.
                One evening in late November, the Huntington family had gathered
                after dinner to play their musical instruments. These included a
                bass viol, cello, cornet and drum. A stranger soon came to the
                door seeking overnight lodging. He was welcomed in and
                Grandmother Huntington prepared a light supper for him: </p>
            <p class="quote">It was the custom to read a portion of the
                scriptures before going to bed. He again joined the circle, and
                father Huntington began to read from the Holy Bible, a portion
                of the New Testament, to which they all listened attentively.
                Grandmother Huntington made some comment on the fact that they
                would like to hear the Gospel in its fullness as explained and
                taught by the Saviour. The stranger immediately took up the
                subject and began explaining the scriptures and quoting the
                sayings of the Saviour in what seemed to them a new light and
                greater beauty than they had ever thought of before. ... When
                the Gospel to life and salvation was brought to them by Hyrum
                Smith and other Elders, they seemed to coincide with what the
                stranger had told them concerning the Bible and the restoration
                of the Gospel. All the family but one accepted the Gospel and
                prepared to emigrate in a few years to Kirtland; here they met
                the Prophet of God, Joseph Smith, and became his faithful and
                loyal followers and friends. [When] Brother Huntington related
                this little incident to him, [Joseph] laid his hand on his head
                and said: “My dear brother, that man was one of the three
                Nephites who came to prepare you for the restoration of the
                Gospel and its acceptance.” (Lundwall, Nels B., “The Prophet
                Joseph Identifies The Stranger,” in Assorted Gems of Priceless
                Value, as related by President Wm. R. Sloan to Nels Lundwall,
                Sept. 1938, Portland, Oregon.)</p>
            <p>Al was baptized at age nine. His family moved with the Saints
                from Kirtland, Ohio, to Far West, Missouri, to Nauvoo, Illinois,
                and finally to Utah. Al’s father, Dimick, helped construct the
                temples in Kirtland and Nauvoo. He served as a coroner in Nauvoo
                and helped prepare Joseph Smith’s body for burial after the
                martyrdom. Dimick also served in the Mormon Battalion and took
                his family along with him. Al was fifteen years old at the time.
                After arriving in the Salt Lake Valley in July 1847 with the
                discharged Pueblo detachment, Al’s father wrote:</p>
            <p class="quote">Through all my travels in the Battalion ... I
                carried in my wagon a bushel of wheat, and during the winter of
                1847, slept with it under my bed, keeping it for seed. For three
                months my family tasted no bread. We dug thistle roots and other
                native growths and had some poor beef, with a little milk, but
                no butter. Early in the spring of 1848, I (Dimick) rode one
                hundred and fifteen miles to Fort Bridger and bought a quart of
                little potatoes about the size of pigeon eggs, at twenty-five
                cents each. From these I raised that year about a bushel of
                potatoes, but ate none of them. I planted them in 1849 and have
                had plenty of potatoes ever since.” (Heart Throbs of the West,
                Kate B. Carter, Vol. 6, p. 432)</p>
            <p>Al worked and gave service in many capacities for the Church and
                Utah. He went on several scouting expeditions for the Church and
                was a stock man, a body guard for Brigham Young, and an Indian
                interpreter. He was one of the first white men to master Indian
                languages in Utah. As an interpreter for a peace commission
                during the Black Hawk War, Al endured the abuse of being struck
                in the face by a hostile Indian warrior, and mocked by him,
                calling Al a boy instead of a man. The fearlessness of Al and
                the others at this time facilitated a peace treaty. Another time
                Brigham Young sent Al to negotiate peace with Uintah Indian
                Chief Tabby, when Tabby was preparing to join with Black Hawk
                and cut off the isolated communities in southern Utah. From a
                family history we learn about Al’s success on this mission:</p>
            <p class="quote">Brigham Young as a seer and prophet of the living
                God promised Huntington that no harm would befall him if he
                undertook the task. With that promise in mind, Huntington did as
                directed. He went to Tabby’s camp and attempted to deliver the
                President’s message, but the Indians were too angry to listen to
                words of peace. Oddly no attempt was made at first to harm
                Huntington, probably due to the amazement that a white man would
                come alone to their village. But as he attempted again and again
                to preach peace to them, they became more and more angry ...
                when a messenger arrived to tell them that Sanpitch had been
                killed. The Indians were now ready to kill Huntington in
                retaliation. ... But Sowiette, ... rose to his feet and took the
                Indians to task for their attitude. ... Sowiette reminded them
                that it took the utmost courage to come to their village alone,
                as Huntington had done. He told them that since the brave man
                had come in peace he should be allowed to leave in peace. ...
                The Indians let Huntington return to his home unharmed just as
                President Young had promised him.” (Creer Family History:
                William Madison Wall)</p>
            <p>Al was a scout for many trips and hunting expeditions. He went on
                a hunting trip as a scout for Buffalo Bill (William Cody) and a
                party of two English Lords. (See Southern Utah University,
                Gerald R. Sherratt Library, Special Collections.)</p>
            <p>Al worked for Warren Johnson at Lee’s Ferry. During this time
                Johnson had an accident and Al served as a surrogate father to
                Warren’s children. He taught the boys life skills and shooting.
                Frank Johnson said that “Al was a perfectionist when teaching
                it. The boys were always trying to get Al to do shooting tricks
                and would do his chore of chopping the wood if he could do
                marksmanship tricks that they deemed impossible. I think we
                chopped the wood most of the time.” Those who knew Al best also
                spoke of his gift of prophecy which they witnessed. He also
                spent time each fall getting wagon loads of wood for widows and
                those in need. Because Al was such a good friend to the Indians,
                they often visited him toward the end of his life and brought
                him fresh meat. Jody Johnson said: “Daddy Huntington lived with
                us for about fifteen years. ... He was just like a father to us
                kids.” Another daughter, Lydia Johnson, said that “Al used to
                tell them stories and entertain them ... make toys and things
                for them.”</p>
            <p>In 1856, Al participated in rescuing the pioneers who were late
                getting to Utah. He was one of four named boys who assisted the
                Martin Handcart Company across the Sweetwater River into
                Martin’s Cove. Heroic-size monuments now stand on the footpath
                near Martin’s Cove in honor of these named boys. John Jaques of
                the Martin Company wrote:</p>
            <p class="quote">The passage of the Sweetwater at this point was a
                severe operation to many of the company. It was the worst river
                crossing of the expedition and the last. The water was not less
                than two feet deep, perhaps, a little more in the deepest parts,
                but it was intensely cold. The ice was three or four inches
                thick, and the bottom of the river muddy or sandy. I forget
                exactly how wide the stream was there, but I think thirty or
                forty yards. ... Before the crossing was completed, the shades
                of evening were closing around ... Four members of the relief
                party waded the river, helping the handcarts through and
                carrying the women and children and some of the weaker men over.
                They were D[avid] P. Kimball, George W. Grant, Stephen W.
                Taylor, and C.A. Huntington.</p>

            <p class="quote">We came to the Sweetwater River and there we had to
                cross. We thought we should have to wade as the cattle had been
                crossing with the wagons with the tents and what little flour we
                had and had broken the ice. But there were brave men there in
                the water, packing the women and children over on their backs.
                Those brethren were in the water all day.</p>
            <p>Both Frank Johnson and Al’s son, Alexander Wiley, stated that Al
                afterward developed a cough that never left him. Frank stated
                that “Clark Allen suffered from severe coughing spells for most
                of his life. These spells started after his experience of
                carrying the Martin Handcart Saints across the Sweet Water River
                in Wyoming in 1856.” Alexander Wiley said that his father
                “contracted a cough when he had helped the people at the
                Sweetwater and that it stayed with him all the rest of his life,
                eventually causing his death.” Al died at the home of Warren
                Johnson and was buried in Kanab, Utah, on November 16, 1896.</p>

            <h3>Activites</h3>
            <p> Here is a run down of the activities and skills the youth did
            </p>
            <h4>Hatchet throwing</h4>
            <p>The youth were shown the proper way to throw a hatchet into wood.
                Some did great and other need a lot more practice. This is not
                an easy skill to learn and do repeatedly.</p>
            <h4>Musket shooting</h4>
            <p>What is it like to shoot a musket gun? Well they had the
                opportunity to learn and shoot a target. Most were surprised at
                how loud the pistols are and how the gun recoils.</p>
            <h4>roping</h4>
            <p>They got the opportunity to practice roping a steer head. This is
                not as easy as it looks and it takes a lot of practice and
                determination to do correctly.</p>
            <h4>cutting wood with 2 man saw</h4>
            <p>Have you ever tried to cut a tree using a 2 man saw? These saws
                are long and heavy and do not cut as easy as you would expect.
                They take practice to get the timing down so that each person
                can pull the saw at the right time and get the logs cut.</p>
            <h4>Dance etiquette</h4>
            <p>This was an interesting activity in that the youth learned a few
                things about dance etiquette from the pioneer days. One such
                rule was that if a girl was asked to dance, they could not say
                no. If they did, they were done dancing for the night.</p>
            <h4>Fire starting with flit</h4>
            <p>Very few of the youth were able to actually start a fire using
                flint. Most of the youth were too scared to strike the flint and
                steel together hard enough to produce a spark. For a lot of them
                this was a scarry prospect.</p>
            <h4>bow and arrow shooting</h4>
            <p>How hard is it to shoot an arrow straight using a bow from the
                1800's? Quite hard for most of the youth. This was another fun
                activity to show them that life was not so easy and it took a
                lot of work to survive.</p>
