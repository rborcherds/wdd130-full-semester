                Here is a run down of some of the activities and skills the youth learned about and participated in
                doing
            </h2>
            <section class="hatchet">
                <h4>Hatchet throwing</h4>
                <p class="activity-text">The youth were shown the proper way to throw a hatchet into wood. Some did
                    great and other need a lot
                    more practice. This is not an easy skill to learn and do repeatedly.</p>

                <h4>Musket shooting</h4>
                <p class="activity-text">What is it like to shoot a musket gun? Well they had the opportunity to learn
                    and shoot a target.
                    Most were surprised at how loud the pistols are and how the gun recoils.</p>

                <h4>roping</h4>
                <p class="activity-text">They got the opportunity to practice roping a steer head. This is not as easy
                    as it looks and it
                    takes a
                    lot of practice and determination to do correctly.</p>

                <h4>cutting wood with 2 man saw</h4>
                <p class="activity-text">Have you ever tried to cut a tree using a 2 man saw? These saws are long and
                    heavy and do not cut as
                    easy
                    as you would expect. They take practice to get the timing down so that each person can pull the saw
                    at the right
                    time and get the logs cut.</p>

            <section class="dance">
                <h4>Dance etiquette</h4>
                <p class="activity-text">This was an interesting activity in that the youth learned a few things about
                    dance etiquette from
                    the pioneer days. One such rule was that if a girl was asked to dance, they could not say no. If
                    they
                    did, they were done dancing for the night.</p>

            <section class="fire-starting">
                <h4>Fire starting with flint</h4>
                <p class="activity-text">Very few of the youth were able to actually start a fire using flint. Most of
                    the youth were too scared to strike the flint and steel together hard enough to produce a spark. For
                    a lot of them this
                    was a scarry prospect.

                <h4>Sling Shot</h4>
                <p class="activity-text">One of the activities that a lot of the youth and adult enjoyed was learning
                    the correct way to shoot a sling shot. Sling shots back then did not have the stabilizing features
                    that they have today. You had to learn to keep them straight using just your hands.</p>
